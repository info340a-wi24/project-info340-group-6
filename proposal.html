      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Wildfires are a growing threat to the safety of people
        and properties alike, all across the United States,
        and especially in western states like Washington,
        Oregon, and California. While Central and Eastern Washington
        have always struggled with fires, they've began to spread
        farther West as we see from fires like the Bolt Creek fire
        in 2022. With climate change we can expect to see these fires
        getting more and more common in areas less and less
        prepared to deal with it. One of the first steps to keeping
        up with the increasing wildfire threat is being prepared, and
        that's something we aim to help with.

      <h2>Past Solutions</h2>
      <p>
        Many web apps exist for fire tracking, take for example
        <a href="https://www.fireweatheravalanche.org/fire/state/washington">FireWeatherAvalanche.org</a>.
        this page has an interactive map that gives lots of information on fire and other severe weather all
        across the US. Its very handy for checking fire status anywhere and provides excellent fire statistics,
        but it doesn't include fire advice or alert you of fire proximity, you have to sort through
        the information it presents to know if the fire is near you and how concerned you should be (it doesn't)
        give evacuation levels for areas, for example).
        Our goal is to make a more personal and more targeted web app aimed at keeping Washington residents
        aware of and prepared for fire threats!

      <h2>Our Solution</h2>
      <p>
        We plan to make a web application that helps keep people aware
        of fires near them, evacuation levels, and gives advice on
        what action to take based  on proximity to a fire. The app
        will also allow users to report fire incidents near now,
        or suspected fire incidets. This app will be accessible to everyone
        in Washington, and potentially even more of the US!

      <h2>Functionality</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          User will be able to register for an account,
          to track their chosen address for fire alerts
        </li>
        <li>
          User will be able to post suspected fire sitings
          on the site, or certain users (maybe admin?) will
          be able to post official fire updates on the site.
          Fire alert messages will be sent to people with
          addresses logged near the location
        </li>
        <li>
          Users will have access to a variety of fire / evacuation
          advice, with certain advice being reccomended at closer
          proximity to fire. We plan to source fire safety information
          from <a href="https://www.usfa.fema.gov/index.html">the US Fire Administration</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        By making users more aware of fire danger through alerts
        (not using javascript alerts, don't worry),
        enabling quick official reporting of potential fires,
        and presenting up-to-date fire safety information
        we hope to make fire season safer for everyone in Washington State
