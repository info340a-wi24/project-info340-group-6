    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Wildfires are a growing threat to the safety of people
      and properties alike, all across the United States,
      and especially in western states like Washington,
      Oregon, and California. While Central and Eastern Washington
      have always struggled with fires, they've began to spread
      farther West as we see from fires like the Bolt Creek fire
      in 2022. With climate we can expect to see these fires
      getting more and more common in areas less and less
      prepared to deal with it. One of the first steps to keeping
      up with the increasing wildfire threat is being prepared, and
      that's something we aim to help with.

    <h2>Our Solution</h2>
    <p>
      We plan to make a web application that helps keep people aware
      of fires near them, evacuation levels, and gives advice on
      what action to take based  on proximity to a fire. The app
      will also allow users to report fire incidents near now,
      or suspected fire incidets.

    <h2>Functionality</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        User will be able to register for an account,
        to track their chosen address for fire alerts
      </li>
      <li>
        User will be able to post suspected fire sitings
        on the site, or certain users (maybe admin?) will
        be able to post official fire updates on the site.
        Fire alert messages will be sent to people with
        addresses logged near the location
      </li>
      <li>
        Users will have access to a variety of fire / evacuation
        advice, with certain advice reccomended at closer
        proximity to fire.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      By making users more aware of fire danger through alerts
      (not using javascript alerts, don't worry),
      enabling quick official reporting of potential fires,
      and presenting up-to-date fire safety information
      we hope to make fire season safer for everyone in Washington State
